# Sample data file 

## Anonymization
The sample data was subsequently completely anonymized. 
The variables Timestamp, LocationName, StreetName, Longitude, and Latitude were removed. 
Street names and personal/company names have been removed from the accident descriptions. 

## Preparation 
Variables not coded by the police were not added. 
There may be incorrect coding by the police. 

# Data acqusition 
In Germany, police accident data can be requested free of charge directly from the police authorities 
in the respective federal states or via platforms such as https://fragdenstaat.de/en/ for re- search purposes. 
The research data centers of the federal states also offer the possibility of obtaining 
police accident data as so-called microdata (https://www.forschungsdatenzentrum.de/en/request).
